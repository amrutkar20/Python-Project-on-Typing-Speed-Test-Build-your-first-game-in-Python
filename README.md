•	Background.jpg – A background image we will use in our program.   

•	Icon.png – An icon image that we will use as a reset button.

•	Sentences.txt – This text file will contain a list of sentences separated by a new line.

•	Speed typing.py – The main program file that contains all the code.

•	Typing-speed-open.png – The image to display when starting the game

1. Import the required modules:

2. Create the game class.

3. draw_text() method

4. get_sentence() method

5. show_results() method

6. run() method

7. reset_game() method
